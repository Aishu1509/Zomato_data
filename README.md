# Zomato_data_analysis


Overview
The "Zomato Data Analysis" project involves exploring and analyzing a dataset from Zomato to extract meaningful insights about restaurants, cuisines, locations, and user reviews. Implemented in Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda Navigator, the project combines data analysis and visualization techniques to uncover trends and patterns in the food and dining industry.

Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand key metrics and relationships.
- Visualizations for insights into:
  - Restaurant density by location.
  - Popular cuisines and ratings.
  - Cost analysis for different restaurant types.
- Advanced visualizations with colorful and grouped plots.

Libraries Used
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical computations.
- `matplotlib`: For static visualizations.
- `seaborn`: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations.

How to Run
1. Clone this repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed via Anaconda Navigator.
3. Install the required Python libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
   Alternatively, use Anaconda for package management:
   ```bash
   conda install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```
4. Open the notebook and execute the cells step by step.

File Structure
- ZomatoDataAnalysis.ipynb: The main notebook containing data preprocessing, analysis, and visualizations.

Key Visualizations
- Count plots showing the distribution of restaurants by city.
- Box plots for cost analysis across cuisines.
- Heatmaps to visualize correlations between features like ratings and cost.

Insights Gained
- Identified cities with the highest density of restaurants.
- Uncovered the most popular cuisines and their corresponding average ratings.
- Analyzed cost trends for dining across various locations and restaurant types.

Future Improvements
- Integrate machine learning for predictive analysis (e.g., rating prediction).
- Expand the dataset to include user demographics and feedback.
- Enhance visualizations with interactive tools like Plotly or Dash.
